RPX AI Drives

RPX AI Drives is a lightweight FiveM resource that adds immersive NPC drivers to your server. Instead of static NPCs, this script spawns peds into vehicles and gives them natural wandering driving tasks. NPCs continue to drive across the map, creating a more lively and realistic world for your roleplay server.

✨ Key Features

Immersive AI Traffic – NPCs spawn in configured locations and actively drive around the city, county, or wherever you place them.
Custom Vehicle Support – Works with GTA default vehicles and addon/custom cars. NPCs can drive the same cars your players use, giving your world a consistent theme.
Sync-Safe – Entities are networked so all players see the same vehicles and NPCs driving, even when joining mid-session.
Restart-Safe – Handles cleanup on resource stop/restart to prevent duplication or stacked spawns.
Configurable – Easily control spawn points, ped models, vehicle types, liveries, and driving speeds through config.lua.
Optimized – Lightweight with minimal resource usage, designed to run smoothly on busy servers.
